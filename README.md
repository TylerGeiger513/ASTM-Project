# ASTM-Project
Node JS Puppeteer application that aids in logging journals to the electronic copyright office...

When this project is run (node .) in the command line, it will open up an instance of chromium automated by Puppeteer.js, it will continue to search for the necessary input forms and autofill them with the information from the spreadsheets provided.
So far it is working except I am unable to incriment the journals array when autofilling - so it will continue to autofill the same information every time...
